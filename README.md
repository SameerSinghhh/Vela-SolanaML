## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost ta shap matplotlib seaborn
```

### Step 1: Data Preparation
1. **Insert Raw Data**: Download historical price data from Yahoo Finance and insert into the respective `raw_price_data_*.csv` files in the `price_data/` directory:
   - `raw_price_data_sol.csv` (Solana)
   - `raw_price_data_btc.csv` (Bitcoin)
   - `raw_price_data_eth.csv` (Ethereum)
   - `raw_price_data_dxy.csv` (Dollar Index)
   - `raw_price_data_vix.csv` (Volatility Index)

2. **Data Cleaning**: Execute the data standardization pipeline:
```bash
cd price_data/
python clean_csv_data.py
```
- **Purpose**: Converts raw Yahoo Finance format to standardized CSV structure
- **Inputs**: `raw_price_data_*.csv` files with inconsistent formatting
- **Outputs**: Cleaned `price_data_*.csv` files with uniform date/price columns

### Step 2: Feature Matrix Generation
1. **Configure Date Range**: Edit `create_feature_matrix.py` to set desired analysis period:
```python
start_date = datetime(2023, 7, 23)  # Modify as needed
end_date = datetime(2025, 7, 30)    # Modify as needed
```

2. **Generate Features**: Execute the feature engineering pipeline:
```bash
python create_feature_matrix.py
```
- **Purpose**: Creates comprehensive feature matrix with technical and macroeconomic indicators
- **Inputs**: Cleaned price data files (`price_data_*.csv`) and FEDFUNDS data
- **Outputs**: `feature_matrix.csv` (739 rows × 27 columns including target variable)

3. **Data Validation**: Verify feature matrix integrity using [CSV Viewer Online](https://csv-viewer-online.github.io/):
   - Upload `feature_matrix.csv` to inspect data completeness
   - Ensure no missing values in critical features
   - Verify proper date range coverage and feature distributions

### Step 3: Model Training and Simulation
```bash
python test_model_simplified.py
```
- **Purpose**: Executes complete ML pipeline including training, testing, and trading simulation

### Configuration Options
**Transaction Cost Analysis**: Toggle realistic trading costs in `test_model_simplified.py`:
```python
ENABLE_TRANSACTION_COSTS = True  # Set to False for theoretical analysis
```

**SHAP Analysis**: Adjust sample sizes for computational efficiency:
```python
shap_sample_size = 100  # Reduce for faster execution on large datasets
```
